OREAj - Optimization of Regular Expressions using Evolutionary Algorithms (in Java)
==================================================================================

![build](https://travis-ci.org/jenshadlich/OREAj.svg?branch=master)

Originally, this was written in Haskell and later rewritten in Java. This Java version still misses some features and tools of the Haskell version. But all in all, it's working :)

Currently adopting for Java 8 and porting features.
